# Lyme Bites
Classifier of tick bite vs. mosquito bite vs. healthy skin. 

Tick bite classifier: Can we detect a tick bite from a mosquito bite or healthy skin? Original inspiration for this classifier came from the "Automated detection of erythema migrans and other confounding skin lesions via deep learning" paper (link here link text) out of Johns Hopkins's Applied Physics Lab, Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare, Department of Dermatology, and the Lyme Disaese Research Center, Division of Rheumatology, at JHU's Department of Medicine.

The Trouble with Lyme Disease Diagnosis Diagnosing Lyme Disease is still a herculean task. There are very high false positives as well as false negatives. Patients who are lucky enough to identify a bulls-eye looking tick bite, also known as Erythema Migrans, can go to their doctor, acquire Doxycycline to pre-empt the development of the bacteria, Borrelia Burgdorferi, that causes Lyme Disease.

Becaure there have been no databases of tick bite images, the paper above sought to build out such a dataset and apply a deep learning classifier to identify erythema migrans apart from other skin lesions.

Note: This notebook was leveraged from Fast AIv and is soon to be updated with version 4.
